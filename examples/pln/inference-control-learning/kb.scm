;; The knowledge-base is the upper case latin alphabet order. The order
;; relationship is represented with Inheritance between 2 consecutive
;; letters:
;;
;; Inheritance (stv 1 1)
;;   Concept "A" (stv 1/26 1)
;;   Concept "B" (stv 2/26 1)
;;
;; ...
;;
;; Inheritance (stv 1 1)
;;   Concept "Y" (stv 25/26 1)
;;   Concept "Z" (stv 26/26 1)
;;
;; The concept strengths, 1/26 to 26/26, are defined to be consistent
;; with PLN semantics, otherwise rules like Inversion by come by
;; inference a lot of crazy shit about the order. Another option would
;; be to use a less-than transitive predicate.
