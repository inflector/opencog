; OVERVIEW
; --------
; The scripts below use a simple spanning-tree (MST) parser to create
; MST parse of a sentence. The goal of this parse is to create a base
; set of link-grammar disjuncts.
;
; Input to this should be a single sentence. It is presumed, as
; background, that a large number of word-pairs with associated mutual
; information is already avaialable from the atomspace (obtained
; previously).
;
; The algorithm implemented is a basic maximum spanning tree algorithm.
; Conceptually, the graph to be spanned by the tree is a clique, with
; with every word in the sentence being connected to every other word.
; The edge-lengths are given by the mutual information betweeen word-pairs
; (although perhaps other metrics are possible; see below).
;
; The spanning tree is then obtained. Finally, disjuncts are created from
; the resulting parse, by looking at how each word is attached to the
; other words.  The disjuncts are then recorded.

; Tokenize the text: take the input sentence, and return a list of the
; words in the sentence.  It is assumed that words are always separated
; by white-space, so this is easy. This also makes a vague attempt to
; also separate commas, periods, and other punctuation.  Returned is a
; list of words.
;
; This is not terribly rigorous; it treats a somewhat arbitrary
; selection of oddball unicode punctuation marks as prefixes and
; suffixes. This list is not complete nor terribly organized; rather,
; it is built up from experience of parsing assorted texts and noting
; the kinds of stuff that actually gets used. Its slanted towards
; European langauges, and may be inadequate for other langauges.
;
; I did not want to get too fancy here; I want just enough to parse
; most "ordinary" text, for now.  A fancier treatment must await
; generalized handling of morphology, at which point, we can treat
; any kind of affixes, and not just punctuation.  So its kind of
; pointless to try to replace the code below by something "better",
; unless the better thing is full morphology support.
